From the newest Mathematica docs, the types of Wolfram Language packets returned
by =WSNextpacket= consist of:

| Wolfram Language Packet    | constant      | meaning                                             |
|----------------------------+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| ReturnPacket[expr]         | RETURNPKT     | result from a computation                           |
| ReturnTextPacket["string"] | RETURNTEXTPKT | textual form of a result                            |
| InputNamePacket["name"]    | INPUTNAMEPKT  | name of a input line                                |
| OutputNamePacket["name"]   | OUTPUTNAMEPKT | name of a output line                               |
| TextPacket["string"]       | TEXTPKT       | textual output form from functions like =Print=       |
| MessagePacket[symb,"tag"]  | MESSAGEPKT    | name of a message generated by the Wolfram Language |
|----------------------------+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| InputPacket["prompt"]      | INPUTPKT      | request for a response to an =Input= function         |
| CallPacket[i,list]         | CALLPKT       | request for a call to an external function          |

As a lite frontend, we only need to handle =RETURNPKT= and =TEXTPKT=, possibly including =MESSAGEPKT=
for below reasons:

+ =INPUTNAMEPKT= and =OUTPUTNAMEPKT= are trivial.
+ =RETURNTEXTPKT= is for the return of =EnterTextPacket=, as explained in =JLink/tutorial/WritingJavaProgramsThatUseTheWolframLanguage=, which is not the way we are to implement the session.
+ Users will not try to call external programs in an tm document, thus =CALLPKT= will not be returned.
+ =INPUTPKT= is also redundent for a session in tm documents.
