* A Mathematica plugin for TeXmacs

This project provides the functionality to use [[https://texmacs.org][GNU TeXmacs]] as the frontend of Wolfram language

  #+CAPTION: Some demos!

**  UPDATE
*** 2021/12/06

Outputname prefix like ~Out[12]=~ now will not be displayed only when there is one single return,
which is really useful for that wrapped in a executable fold, e.g. a figure in the demo.

Added a ~python~ script to dump all codes within ~mma~ sessions of a ~.tm~ file to a ~.m~ file. This will be
helpful if you want to collect all codes for some specific use case. Run:
#+begin_src sh
  # if path of this script is already added to $PATH
  # use an alias or different link name if you like
  tmdumpcode <path to .tm file like rep.tm> [<target .m file like rep-out.m>]
#+end_src
Then ~rep-out.m~ (or ~rep.m~ if no target is specified) will appear in your current directory.

~⚠️NOTE: This will override your target file. Be careful!~

One night I wanted to neither read books nor sleep, then I rewrote this project.
Now =%= like that in notebook frontend is supported, and, the logic of format and inter-communication
is clarified. (Though it's possible to write =%12=, I personally recommend you not to do like this,
since each time codes are rerun, indices will most probably change.)

** Installation and Use

There are two versions of this plugin. One (~main~ branch) is implemented in cpp utilizing the WSTP interface,
the other (~wolframscript~ branch) is implemented in Wolfram language and run as a wolfram script. The
first one has interactive features like ~%~ as last output, while the second one works out of the box
and require no cpp compilation toolchain.

Check ~wolframscript~ branch for details.

TeXmacs use the dirname in ~plugins~ to mark the name of a plugin. To use two branches simultaneously, you
need to hold one copy of files and manually rename something. Say you will name it ~myplugin~, confirm:
1. dirname in ~$HOME/.TeXmacs/plugins~ to be ~myplugin~ (mma by default)
2. filename in ~$HOME/.TeXmacs/plugins/myplugin/progs~ to be init-myplugin.scm (init-mma.scm by default)
3. names of functions in ~init-myplugin.scm~ (look into the code and you will figure out what to do)
*** ~main~ branch

*NOTE: This one is tested against ArchLinux and OSX 10.15.*

To use this plugin, you need compile it manually since it rely on the WSTP library shipped with your Wolfram.
C++ compilation toolchain is required.
Confirm the directory of ~WolframKernel~ is in ~PATH~,  type ~which WolframKernel~ to check it. Then:

#+begin_src sh
  cd $HOME/.TeXmacs/plugins/
  git clone https://github.com/hammerfunctor/tm-mathematica mma && cd mma
  ./build.sh # or: `WOLFRAM_PATH=/path/to/wolframproduct ./build`
#+end_src

If no error is reported, then next time when you start TeXmacs, this plugin will be available.

*** ~wolframscript~ branch
On Windows, you need to add the directory of ~wolframscript.exe~ to environment variable ~Path~. It may be like
~C:\Program Files\Wolfram Research\Mathematica\13.0\~ for Mathematica
and ~C:\Program Files\Wolfram Research\WolframScript\~ for WolframEngine
(select to enable the extra component wolframscript when installing WolframEngine).

Then enter following in CMD (~git~ is needed. If you don't have git, click in github page to switch to ~wolframscript~
branch, download it as a zip file and put it in your TeXmacs plugin directory and name the directory ~mma~)
#+begin_src sh
  cd %AppData%/Roaming/TeXmacs/plugins
  git clone https://github.com/hammerfunctor/tm-mathematica mma
  cd mma && git checkout wolframscript
#+end_src

On Linux and macOS, find the directory of ~wolframscript~ and add it to ~PATH~. Then
#+begin_src sh
  cd $HOME/.TeXmacs/plugins
  git clone https://github.com/hammerfunctor/tm-mathematica mma
  cd mma && git checkout wolframscript
#+end_src

**** Troubleshooting
On Windows once you add the dir to environment variable PATH, texmacs will correctly recognize this plugin after it
read PATH.

For OSX and Linux the ~PATH~ texmacs get to know is a bit tricky. On Linux the login-shell init file, say =$HOME/.zprofile=
(if you use zsh) is perhaps respected. You can add one line =export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/wolframscript= to your ~.zprofile~.
On OSX texmacs is aware of the existence of ~.zprofile~ if you start it from terminal, while not if you run texmacs from
spotlight search. One workaround is to link ~/usr/local/bin/wolframscript~ to ~/path/to/wolframscript~, which is always in ~PATH~.

** Have fun!
