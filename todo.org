** Transfer =Switch= to a multiple dispatched format function

   Purely for fun, probably with tiny improment in performance.

** Add a global fallback function for default output

   Sometimes I want to show the standard form instead of TeX form, thus a fallback format function
   helps to control the output form, which can be override globally or locally using =Block=.
