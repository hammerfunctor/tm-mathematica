** Add a global fallback function for default output

Sometimes I want to show the standard form instead of TeX form, thus a fallback format function
helps to control the output form, which can be override globally or locally using =Block=.

** Add non-trivial support for magic lines

Like =% -width 0.418par=.

** Implement completion and format

Indentation like that of Scheme plugin.
